The Absurdist framework suggests that life is inherently without meaning, but humans have a desperate need to find meaning. The conflict between this need and the universe's silence is 'the absurd'. The solution is not despair, but rebellion. We must live in spite of the absurd, embracing our freedom and passion. This is the ultimate act of defiance.
